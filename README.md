# *Welcomed to the NeuroOnline* 

 **NeuroOnline** is a platform which was initiated by Konrad Kording (@KordingLab) and maintained by the community, which aims to bring anyone from the neuroscience community together in a series of online meetings to discuss topics from science to brewing beer. This is a platform that welcomes the members of the community, who are interested in sharing their experiences, ideas, discussions over theories, paradigms, or their love of cooking or drinking by simply joining from their own locals.

We had our first successful meeting on 14th March, started in the European time zone and continued towards the American time zones with many researchers from various backgrounds. The next meeting will be held on **Thursdays** at **8:30pm GMT** and/or **8:30pm EST**, please join us at [Zoom](https://zoom.us/j/494356531) You can find the details of the meeting [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16tebVYi5Hawepoge41ip7m9rJEFzf_H3j5EZi6dtFGo/edit?usp=sharing)!

We are still experimenting with the meetings, creating the contents regarding how to run the meetings successfully to make sure that everyone can get as much benefit as they can from all. So please have a look at the materials created so far and let us know what you think, or how we can make the whole concept better and accessible for all. Send your recommendations as issues and let's grow it all together!
